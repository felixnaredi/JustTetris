The current plan is to implement three different interfaces for the
program.

	terminal	: Written in C, drawn in the terminal.
	apple		: Written in Swift, drawn with Cocoa and Metal.
	glfw		: Written in C++, drawn in GLFW window.

I know very little about OS:s other than macOS and Linux. But it would
be nice to try and make iOS and/or Windows versions.

It should either be possible to, at build time or runtime, decide if
the programs interface should use GLFW+OpenGL or ncurses (possible
something else also). The common **node** is the header *interface*,
i.e there will be one implementation of the interface header using
GLFW and one using ncurses.

I do believe that the benefits of providing safe and debug builds will
be worth the effort. However, don't sacrifice to much readability on
it, and perhaps most important - don't get stuck because of them. If
they manage to catch five or more otherwise untracable bugs they will
probably make up for the time implementing them.

There is a GNU library for linear algebra (and allot of other math
related stuff) called GNU Scientific Library. I don't think that much
math needed for the program but it can be good to know.
